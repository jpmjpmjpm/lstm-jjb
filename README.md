## Analyzing LSTM examples

### Partial results
Look at `simple-lstm-pytorch-jpm.py`.

Main topics:
1. Used data normalization with `sklearn`.
2. Need probably to work better at model convergence.
3. Also are 3 samples enough to make predictions? Maybe look at more (5 to 10).
To be studied further.

### LSTM prediction examples:
[Time Series Prediction using LSTM with PyTorch in Python][1]

### TODOs
1. Work on initializations in [Pytorch LSTM](simple-lstm-pytorch-jpm.py).
2. Also work on converge strategy.
